1. I spent around 4 days on the assignment, and an average of 4 hours a day. If I had more time I would more tests to my solution.

2. One of the most useful features that was added to javascript recently is the spread operator, it replaces the object.assign method when creating new objects. {
   ...state,
   city: action.cityName,
   isFetching: true,
   };

3. I would track perfomance by using the Light House audit, based on the result I would perform any fixes that the report states are affecting performance.

4. I would improve the api by adding custom images to the restaurant objects, at the moment it seems to be the same icon for all restaurants.

I would also replace the way the price data is stated in the object, instead of a rating 1-4 I would like to put the average cost per meal to give users a better understanding of the price.

5. I used the Axios library which transforms the JSON data automatically when a request is made so I did not have to use any methods to manually transform incoming data.
