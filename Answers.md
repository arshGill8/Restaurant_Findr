1. I spent 3 days on the assignment, and an average of 4 hours a day. If I had more time I would more learn more about testing and add more tests to my solution.

2. One of the most useful features that was added to javascript recently is the spread operator, it makes code much cleaner by replacing
the object.assign method when creating new objects.
 {
   ...state,
   city: action.cityName,
   isFetching: true,
   };

3. Something that was challenging was writing the tests, I am fairly new to writing tests and need to gain more experience on that subject but I still enjoyed the little testing I was able to accomplish.

4. I would track performance by using the Light House audit, based on the result I would fix any issues that the report states are affecting performance. 

5. I would improve the api by adding custom images to the restaurant objects, at the moment it seems to be the same icon for all restaurants.


6. I used the Axios library which parses JSON data automatically when a request is made so I did not have to use any js methods to manually transform incoming data.
